  #### Features Left to implement 
  * When there is time, I would like to expand this cultural quiz game to include another type of culturals questions with different styles of answering like listing the most relevant keywords or providing some hints and helping routines for end users.

## Testing

### Bugs

#### Solved bugs 

During the final stages of the project, I focused on enhancing performance by reducing image quality, which significantly improved the webpage's loading speed and responsiveness. To troubleshoot a bug in the JavaScript code where the reset button failed to reset the score, I utilized console printing to track the execution flow and identify that the default routine was interfering with the reset function. After pinpointing the issue, I adjusted the code to ensure that the reset button would properly clear the score and restore the game to its initial state.
